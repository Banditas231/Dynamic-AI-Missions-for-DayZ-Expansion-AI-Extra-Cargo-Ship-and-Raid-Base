# Dynamic-AI-Missions-for-DayZ-Expansion-AI
# Extra Cargo Ships and Raid Bases
# Description

These are my extra custom builds that I use with Dynamic AI Missions.

Included in this package:

Cargo Ships (total: 8)
Raid Bases (only a few — anyone can create more)

# Important

Please keep in mind: this is the original mod setup — I only added extra custom-made builds for you to use on your server.
Always make backups before changing anything.

# Installation / Usage
To make these builds work, you must modify or add Loadouts.
The AI does not have fixed spawn positions, so you need to edit:
"Position": [ ]
Best method: place a barrel in-game and copy its position here.

Everything else is provided by the original mod authors.
You are free to adjust loot, AI settings, and other parameters — I only provide the prebuilt structures.

# Known Issues

There is a known bug with Cargo Ships: sometimes the containers do not disappear after the mission ends.
This requires a mod tweak, but I have not seen any fixes yet.

# Workaround:

You can remove all StaticObj_Container_ objects if they are not deleted after the mission is completed.
Suggestions

Anyone is welcome to expand these builds or create additional Raid Bases and Cargo Ships.
